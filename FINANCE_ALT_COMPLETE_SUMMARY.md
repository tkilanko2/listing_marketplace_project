### 2. Pending Earnings Card (Right, Small)

$200.00
2 confirmed bookings to be delivered

────────────────────────────
In hold period: $117.70     ← Optional: if any
```

### 3. Hold Period Changed: 3 Days → 7 Days

**Updated Everywhere:**
- Transaction generation: `holdEndDate = completion + 7 days`
- Settlement timeline in modal
- Comments in code
- Test data (bookings now 10 days old to be past hold)

**New Timeline:**
```
Day 0:  Service completed
Day 1-7: Hold period
Day 7:  Funds available for withdrawal
Day 15/30: Automatic payout
Day 15-30 + 3-7: Funds received in bank
```

### 4. Automated Payouts (Manual Withdrawal Removed)
**How It Works:**
- Seller cannot manually withdraw
- Automatic payouts on 15th and 30th of each month
- System automatically pays out available balance
- 3-7 day processing time to bank account

**UI Changes:**
- No "Withdraw Now" button
- Shows "Next automatic payout" date
- Clear communication about automated schedule

## 📊 Data Structure Updates

### New Function: `getProjectedEarnings()`
```typescript
// Returns projected earnings from confirmed bookings
{
  amount: $200.00,   // Net after fees
  count: 2           // Number of confirmed bookings
}
```

**Logic:**
- Filters: `status === 'confirmed' && paymentStatus === 'paid'`
- Calculates net earnings after all fees
- Only counts seller's bookings (provider ID match)

### Updated Mock Data:
**Confirmed Bookings (for Pending Earnings):**
- BKG-CS-001: $75 (3 days from now)
- BKG-CS-003: $125 (2 days from now)
- Total: ~$200 projected

**Completed Bookings (for Available Balance):**
- BKG-CS-004: $350 (10 days ago - past 7-day hold)
- BKG-CS-007: $400 (10 days ago - past 7-day hold)
- Total: ~$750 available

## 🎨 Visual Updates

### Available Card:
- White background with subtle border
- Green used only for icon and button
- Cleaner, less overwhelming
- Better visual hierarchy

### Pending Card:
- Purple theme (platform color)
- White background with purple border
- Subtle purple tint overlay
- "UPCOMING" badge for clarity
