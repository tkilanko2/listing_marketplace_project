# Finance Page Data Alignment - Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced FinancialTransaction Interface** ✅
Added new fields to support Finance 2 page requirements:
- `listingImage?: string` - Image URL for the listing/service
- `listingName?: string` - Service/Product name  
- `listingId?: string` - Reference to listing for navigation
- `serviceCategory?: string` - Category badge (Fitness, Beauty, etc.)

### 2. **Finance 2 Modal Improvements** ✅
- Added listing image display (24x24 thumbnail)
- Shows listing name prominently
- Shows service category badge
- Fallback layout if no image

### 3. **Navigation Handlers** ✅
- Added `onViewBookingDetails` and `onViewOrderDetails` props
- "View Booking/Order" button wired up
- Closes modal before navigating
- Console logging for debugging

## 🎯 Current Status

### Working:
- ✅ Finance 2 page displays transactions
- ✅ Transaction modal shows image and name
- ✅ Clickable transactions throughout
- ✅ Navigation handlers in place

### To Complete:
- Financial transactions need to be generated from actual completed bookings
- Connection between finance data and appointments data needs to be established
- "View Booking" should navigate to the specific booking page

## 📝 Next Steps (For Manual Completion)

The finance data should be generated from actual seller bookings (appointments). Currently, the static mock transaction data exists separately. 

To make this work:
1. The `allFinancialTransactions` should be generated from completed bookings
2. The bookingId in transactions should match actual booking IDs
3. The "View Booking" navigation should link to the seller booking details page using the bookingId

This requires understanding how the current seller appointments/bookings system works and aligning the financial transactions to use real booking data.
