# Finance Pages - Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Reduced Horizontal Spacing ✅
**Both Pages Updated:**
- Changed from: `py-10 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
- Changed to: `py-8 px-3 sm:px-4 lg:px-6`

**Result:** Less space between content and sidebar border

**Padding Breakdown:**
- Mobile: 12px sides (was 16px)
- Small screens: 16px sides (was 24px)
- Large screens: 24px sides (was 32px)
- Vertical: 32px top/bottom (was 40px)

### 2. Transaction Details Modal - Original Finance Page ✅
**Fixed:** Made recent transactions in Overview tab clickable
- Changed from `<div>` to `<button>` with onClick handler
- Added hover effects (border changes to purple)
- Added eye icon that appears on hover
- Calls `handleTransactionDetails(transaction)` on click

### 3. Transaction Details Modal - Finance 2 ✅
**Already Working:** Modal opens with full details including:
- Customer name (formatted as "Sarah M.")
- Fee breakdown
- Settlement timeline
- Tax information
- Action buttons

### 4. Navigation to Booking/Order Details ✅
**Both Pages Now Support:**
- Click "View Booking" → navigates to booking details page
- Click "View Order" → navigates to order details page
- Detects transaction type automatically (booking_payment vs order_payment)
- Uses proper navigation handlers from App.tsx

**Implementation:**
```tsx
<button onClick={() => {
  if (transaction.bookingId && onViewBookingDetails) {
    onViewBookingDetails(transaction.bookingId);
  } else if (transaction.orderId && onViewOrderDetails) {
    onViewOrderDetails(transaction.orderId);
  }
  setSelectedTransaction(null); // Close modal
}}>
  View {transaction.type === 'booking_payment' ? 'Booking' : 'Order'}
</button>
```
