# Correct Data Understanding - Buyer vs Seller Views

## ðŸ“Š Current Setup

### **Buyer View** (Customer's perspective)
- **MyOrdersPage**: Buyers see ALL their orders (products + services they purchased)
  - Uses: `getAllOrdersWithBookings()` with no seller filter
  - Shows: What the buyer bought from anyone
  
### **Seller View** (Provider's perspective)
- **SellerDashboardAppointments**: Seller's service bookings they need to fulfill
  - Uses: `getServiceBookingsForSeller(CURRENT_SELLER_ID)`
  - Shows: Service bookings where seller is the provider
  
- **SellerOrdersPage**: Seller's PRODUCT orders from customers
  - Uses: `getAllOrdersWithBookings()` then filters:
    ```typescript
    order.type === 'product' && 
    order.items.some((item) => item.product.seller.id === CURRENT_SELLER_ID)
    ```
  - Shows: Product orders where buyer bought from THIS seller
  
- **SellerFinancePage2**: Seller's financial transactions
  - Uses: `getAllOrdersWithBookings()` then filters:
    ```typescript
    order.type === 'service' && 
    order.status === 'completed' && 
    order.paymentStatus === 'paid' &&
    order.service.provider.id === CURRENT_SELLER_ID
    ```
  - Shows: Completed service bookings (from Appointments) that are paid

## âœ… Data Connection Answer

**YES! Data IS connected properly:**

1. **Seller Appointments** â†’ Shows all service bookings seller needs to fulfill
2. **Seller Orders** â†’ Shows product orders customers placed with seller
3. **Seller Finance** â†’ Shows completed & paid service bookings (same data as Appointments, but filtered to completed)

**The connection:**
- Finance page uses the SAME bookings as Appointments page
- Finance only shows the completed + paid ones
- Seller can click "View Booking" to see the original appointment

This is the correct model! âœ…
