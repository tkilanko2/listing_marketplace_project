## Analysis: What's Relevant vs. What's Not

### ✅ Highly Relevant (Keep & Enhance):

1. **Auto-Confirm Settings** - Essential for workflow automation
   - ✅ Matches booking/order logic
   - ✅ Practical business need
   - ⚠️ Currently non-functional (just UI)

2. **Global Seller Policy** - Critical for legal/business operations
   - ✅ Has dedicated SellerPolicyPage with full implementation
   - ✅ Covers cancellation policies, refunds, service terms
   - ✅ Platform vs Custom policy options

3. **Payment & Payouts Section** - Core financial functionality
   - ✅ Bank Account management
   - ✅ Payout Schedule
   - ⚠️ Currently links to Finance page for actual management
   - ⚠️ Tax Information needs implementation

### 🤔 Moderately Relevant (Need Clarification):

1. **Business Profile**
   - Business Information
   - Business Address
   - **Question:** Is this redundant with user profile? Or specifically for business entity details (EIN, business type, etc.)?

2. **KYC Verification**
   - **Question:** Is seller verification part of the platform requirements?
   - **Context:** If payouts are involved, KYC is typically required for compliance
   - Currently shows as "Coming Soon"

3. **Integrations**
   - **Calendar Integration:** ✅ Relevant for service bookings
   - **Shipping Integration:** ✅ Relevant for product orders
   - **AI Features:** 🤔 Nice-to-have, but not core
   - **Accounting:** 🤔 Nice-to-have, export CSV currently available

### ❌ Less Relevant / Placeholder Content:

1. **AI Features** - Too advanced for current scope
2. **Accounting Integrations** - CSV export available, full integration is overkill
3. **Business Verification pending** - Blocked by lack of implementation

---

## Missing but Relevant Settings

Based on the seller dashboard functionality, these settings are **missing** but would be **highly relevant**:

### 1. **Notification Preferences** (Critical)
- Email notifications for:
  - New orders
  - New bookings
  - Order status changes
  - Payment received
  - Messages from customers
  - Reviews received
- SMS notifications (optional)
- In-app notification preferences

### 2. **Availability Management** (For Services)
- Default business hours
- Days off / holidays
- Lead time for bookings
- Maximum advance booking window
- ✅ **Note:** Some of this may already be in listing-level settings

### 3. **Shipping Preferences** (For Products)
- Default shipping methods
- Handling time
- Shipping rates / free shipping thresholds
- Return address
- ✅ **Note:** Some of this may already be in listing-level settings

### 4. **Store Information**
- Store name
- Store description
- Store logo
- Business hours
- Contact information
- Social media links

### 5. **Communication Settings**
- Auto-reply messages
- Response time expectations
- Custom greeting messages
- FAQ templates

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Implement):

1. **Make Toggles Functional**
   - Connect Auto-Confirm Bookings toggle to actual booking logic
   - Connect Auto-Confirm Orders toggle to actual order logic
   - Store settings in state/mockData

2. **Add Notification Preferences**
   - Email notification settings (most critical)
   - Would enhance user experience significantly

3. **Consolidate Payment/Banking Settings**
   - Currently split between Settings page and Finance page
   - Consider making Settings page the source of truth, or remove redundant section

4. **Store Profile/Information**
   - Add basic store information management
   - Keep it separate from user profile

### Medium Priority:

1. **Availability Management**
   - If not already in service listing settings
   - Global defaults would be helpful

2. **Shipping Preferences**
   - If not already in product listing settings
   - Global defaults would streamline operations

3. **Communication Templates**
   - Auto-replies and templates for common scenarios

### Low Priority (Consider Removing or Moving to "Coming Soon"):

1. **AI Features** - Too advanced for MVP
2. **Accounting Integrations** - CSV export sufficient for now
3. **Business Verification** - Until KYC flow is implemented

---

### Proposed Reorganization:

```
