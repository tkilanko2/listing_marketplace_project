# Seller Finance Page Improvements - Implementation Plan

## 📋 Overview
Refactor the Seller Finance page to focus on what sellers actually need based on business rules.

## 🎯 Core Business Rules

### Settlement & Payouts
- **Hold period**: 3 days after service completion
- **Payout frequency**: 15th and 30th (twice monthly)
- **Processing time**: 3-7 working days after payout triggered
- **Express settlement**: 1% fee for early release
- **Disputes**: Freeze funds, deduct from next earnings if paid out

### Customer Display
- Format: "FirstName LastInitial" (e.g., "Sarah M.")
- Link transactions to bookings for full details

### Tax Responsibility
- Sellers responsible for taxes
- Platform does NOT collect/remit
- Tax information included for seller's records

### Refunds
- Deduct from pending earnings (not available balance)
- Post-payout refunds create negative balance (deficit)

## 🏗️ Implementation Structure

### New Data Requirements

  customerName: string;           // "Sarah Johnson" → Display as "Sarah M."
  completionDate?: Date;          // When service completed
  holdEndDate?: Date;             // When hold period ends (completion + 3 days)
  availableDate?: Date;           // When funds become available for withdrawal
  projectedEarnings?: number;      // For upcoming bookings
  refund?: {
    status: 'pending' | 'processed';
    amount: number;
    reason: string;
  };
  dispute?: {
    status: 'open' | 'resolved' | 'lost';

}
```

- Performance metrics that may not apply (monthly targets)
- Mock chart data that doesn't match actual transactions

### Add (Missing)

- ✅ Listing performance analytics
- ✅ Settlement timeline (when money available)

- ✅ Direct links to orders/bookings
- ✅ Tax information (for seller's records)
- ✅ Refund/dispute tracking
- ✅ Month-over-month comparison
- ✅ Top performing listings dashboard

## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Action-Oriented**: Every metric should tell seller "what to do next"
2. **Timeline Clarity**: Always show WHEN money becomes available
3. **Drill-Down**: Click anything → see full details
4. **Privacy**: Customer names shown as "First L." (not "Customer #12345")
5. **Settlement Focus**: Make the payout timeline crystal clear
