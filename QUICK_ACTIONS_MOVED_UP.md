# Quick Actions Moved Higher on Alt Finance Page

## Change Made

**Before:**
```
Right Sidebar Order:
1. Next Payout
2. Quick Actions
3. Account Status
```

**After:**
```
Right Sidebar Order:
1. Quick Actions  ← Moved up
2. Next Payout
3. Account Status
```

## Rationale

- **Action-First Design**: Quick Actions are actionable items, so they should be more prominent
- **Better UX**: Users see what they can DO first, then see informational sections
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Quick Actions card is more interactive and benefits from top placement
- **Scanning Pattern**: Users typically scan top-to-bottom, so important actions should be first

## Benefits

✅ Quick access to Export Reports  
✅ Quick access to Payout History  
✅ Quick access to Banking Settings

✅ More logical flow for user workflow
