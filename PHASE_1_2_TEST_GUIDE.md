# Phase 1 & 2 Testing Guide

## üéØ What We're Testing

1. **Data Creation** - Complex listing saves all rich data
2. **Data Editing** - Both edit modes preserve data
3. **Data Persistence** - Data survives navigation and page changes
4. **Console Validation** - Logs show correct data structures

Listing ID: service-xxxxx
Availability (should be object): {
  "type": "custom",
  "scheduleType": "weekly",
  "customSchedule": {
    "monday": true,
    "tuesday": false,
    "wednesday": true,
    ...
    "timeRanges": [

```

**‚úÖ PASS if:**
