## 🔄 Both Pages Share:

✅ Same data sources (allFinancialTransactions, mockPayoutRecords)
✅ Same spacing (max-w-7xl mx-auto py-10 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8)
✅ Same color palette (platform colors)
✅ Same helper functions (customer name formatting, etc.)
✅ Same business logic (settlement timelines, fee calculations)

The **only difference** is the UI layout and information architecture!

## 📝 Next Steps

After testing both:
1. Choose which design better serves sellers
2. Identify elements from each that work well
3. Consider hybrid approach (e.g., tabs from original + hero cards from alternative)
4. Finalize single design for production

Test and share your feedback! 🚀
