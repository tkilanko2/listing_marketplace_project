2. **Business Hours & Availability** - Essential for service bookings
3. **Fix Payment & Payouts CTAs** - Connect to Finance page properly

### Phase 2 - Important (Do Soon):
4. **Communication Settings** - Auto-replies and templates
5. **Privacy & Profile Visibility** - Control over information display
6. **Remove Auto-Confirm Orders** - Clean up what's not needed

### Phase 3 - Nice to Have (Do Later):
7. **Account Security enhancements** - If not already in general Settings
8. **Operational Preferences** - Workflow optimizations

---

## Specific Tasks for Implementation

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Remove/Clean Up:**
   - ❌ Remove "Auto-Confirm Orders" toggle
   - ❌ Remove AI Features integration card
   - ❌ Remove Shipping integration card
   - ❌ Remove Accounting integration card
   - ❌ Remove "Business Profile" section (redundant with My Shop)
   - ❌ Remove "KYC Verification" section (not needed now)

2. **Fix Existing:**
   - ✅ Connect "Bank Account" → "Modify" to Banking Settings page
   - ✅ Connect "Payout Schedule" → "Change" to Finance page
   - ✅ Connect "Tax Information" → "Complete" to Banking Settings page
   - ✅ Keep Calendar integration as-is
   - ✅ Keep Auto-Confirm Bookings toggle as-is

3. **Add New (Priority 1):**
   - 🔔 **Notifications Section** - Full email notification preferences
   - ⏰ **Business Hours Section** - Operating hours and availability management
   - 💬 **Communication Section** - Auto-replies and templates

---

## Summary: Absolute Must-Haves

After removing fluff and considering what's already in My Shop, sellers **absolutely need**:

1. ✅ **Policy Management** (already have via SellerPolicyPage)
2. ✅ **Payment/Banking info** (already have, just need to fix CTAs)
3. ⭐ **Notification Preferences** (MISSING - critical gap)
4. ⭐ **Business Hours Management** (MISSING - shown but not editable)
5. ⭐ **Communication/Auto-Reply Settings** (MISSING - would greatly improve UX)
6. ✅ **Calendar Integration** (already have)
7. 🤔 **Privacy/Security Settings** (may exist in general Settings)

**The biggest gap is Notification Preferences** - this is table stakes for any seller platform.

---

## Questions for Clarification:

1. **Account Security:** Is there a general "Settings" page with password/2FA? Or does this need to be in Seller Settings?

2. **Business Hours:** Should we make the existing Shop Information → Business Hours section editable, or create a separate settings section?

3. **Notifications Priority:** Should we implement basic email notifications first, or is SMS/push also needed in v1?

4. **Communication Templates:** Is this a must-have for v1, or can it wait for v2?

5. **Privacy Settings:** How much control over profile visibility do sellers need? (Show/hide contact info, etc.)
