Seller Profile creation (Found in Profile/ Seller Dashboard/Settings page):
-When a user creates a listing, then the seller dashboard feature is enabled for them no matter the status of the listing. Once this is available, should not be disabled 
-A pop up for sellers to fill their profile should be displayed immediately after creating and submitting the listing. Without the profile completely filled, the listing will be left in pending status
    -Also, sellers must pass KYC or KYB verification before their listing can be live
    -After first listing goes live, the future listing can go live immediately 
-Listing Creation: Users click "Create Listing" and fill out a form, which goes into a pending state on the my shop page on the seller dashboard.
-Seller Profile: Sellers must complete their profile details. Choose between Individual (KYC) or Business (KYC + KYB) verification. Based on this, the forms details should show
