# Finance Page Zero Balance - Issue & Fix

## 🔍 Problem Identified

From the screenshot, the Finance page shows:
- **Available to Withdraw**: $0.00
- **Pending**: $0.00
- Total Revenue: $6,249.38 (exists)
- 50 transactions showing

## ❓ Root Cause

The finance page is showing transactions, but they're likely:
1. Not from completed bookings
2. Provider IDs don't match `CURRENT_SELLER_ID`
3. All transactions are still in hold period (very recent)

Looking at the data, there ARE completed bookings (BKG-CS-004, BKG-CS-006, etc.) with `status: 'completed'` and `paymentStatus: 'paid'`.

However, the issue is likely that:
- The `availableDate` is in the future (still in hold period)
- Or the provider IDs don't match when filtering

## ✅ Fix Applied

Updated the transaction generation to:
1. Filter by current seller's provider ID
2. Only include completed + paid bookings
3. Calculate proper settlement dates:
   - Completion date = appointment date
   - Hold period = 3 days
   - Available date = completion + 3 days

## 📊 Expected Result After Fix

Once transactions are generated correctly, you should see:
- **Available Balance**: Money from bookings completed > 3 days ago
- **Pending Balance**: Money from bookings completed < 3 days ago
- Each transaction showing "Available Now" or "Available [date]"
- Real balance amounts, not $0.00

## 🎯 Current Status

The code changes are in place to:
- Filter transactions by current seller only
- Show proper settlement timeline
- Display available vs pending balances correctly

**The page should now show real data!** ✅
