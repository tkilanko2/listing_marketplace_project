# Phase 2: Edit Functionality - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Phase 2 successfully implemented comprehensive edit functionality with TWO edit modes:
1. **Edit** (Traditional UI) - Simpler tab-based editor

## Technical Details

### Field Mapping (Service ↔ FormValues)

```typescript
// Forward mapping (CREATE/EDIT)
title → name
detailedDescription → longDescription
(existing fields preserved)

// Reverse mapping (EDIT only)
name → title
longDescription → detailedDescription
serviceCities → serviceCities (rich object)
availability → availability (rich object)
tiers → pricingTiers (array)
```

### Edit Page Capabilities

| Feature | Traditional Edit | Quick Edit |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Basic fields (name, category, status) | ✅ Edit | ✅ Edit |
| Descriptions | ✅ Edit | ✅ Edit |
| Availability schedules | ⚠️ View only | ✅ Full Edit |
| Service delivery modes | ⚠️ View only | ✅ Full Edit |
| Service coverage/cities | ⚠️ View only | ✅ Full Edit |
| Pricing tiers | ⚠️ View only | ✅ Full Edit |
| Payment options | ⚠️ View only | ✅ Full Edit |
| Media/images | ⚠️ Placeholder | ✅ Full Edit |
| **Data preservation** | ✅ All data | ✅ All data |

### Data Structures Preserved

Both edit modes now properly handle:
- ✅ Rich availability object (schedules, time ranges, date ranges)
- ✅ serviceDeliveryModes array
- ✅ serviceCities array with radius data
- ✅ Pricing tiers with full details
- ✅ Payment options
- ✅ All metadata (views, saves, reviews, etc.)
