# Transaction List Display - Simplified

## Change Made

### Before:
```
$350.00 → $330.55 net
```

### After:
```
$350.00
```

## Rationale

- **Cleaner UI**: Less visual clutter in the transaction list
- **Consistency**: Matches how other financial platforms display amounts
- **Details Available**: Seller can still see full breakdown (including net) in the transaction details modal when they click "Details"
- **Focus**: Shows the booking/transaction value without forcing calculation complexity

## Where Net Earnings Are Still Shown

1. **Available Balance Card**: Shows net earnings total
2. **Transaction Details Modal**: Full fee breakdown (Platform Fee, Processing Fee, Transaction Fee, Net Earnings)
3. **CSV Export**: "Net Earnings" column shows actual earnings
4. **Summary Cards**: Balance cards show net totals

The transaction list now simply shows the **booking value** (gross amount), keeping it clean and scannable.

✅ Transaction list simplified to show gross amount only!
