# Edit UX Improvements - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Enhanced the listing edit experience with consistent terminology and comprehensive availability display.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Consistent Button Text

**Problem:** Confusing terminology in edit mode
- Quick Edit showed "Submit Listing" even when editing
- Traditional Edit showed "Save Changes" 
- Users couldn't tell the difference

**Solution:** Context-aware button text in ServiceListingForm
- **CREATE mode** → "Submit Listing"
- **EDIT mode** → "Save Changes"
- ✅ Both edit pages now use consistent language

#### Files Modified:
- `src/components/forms/ServiceListingForm.tsx`
  - Button text: Line 2393
  - Page title: Line 2326
  - Success dialog title: Line 2676
  - Success dialog message: Lines 2683, 2686-2688

### 2. ✅ Added Availability Tab to Traditional Edit

**Problem:** Missing availability information
- Traditional Edit had no way to view availability schedules
- Users had to switch to Quick Edit just to see availability
- Service coverage and delivery modes were hidden

**Solution:** Added comprehensive **Availability** tab

#### Tab Navigation
Traditional Edit now has 6 tabs:
1. Basic Details
2. Media
3. Attributes
4. Pricing & Inventory
5. **Availability** ← NEW
6. SEO & Visibility

#### Availability Tab Features

**Displays:**
- ✅ Current availability schedule (weekdays, weekends, custom)
- ✅ Available days with visual badges
- ✅ Time ranges for each day
- ✅ Date ranges (if applicable)
- ✅ Service delivery modes (at seller, at buyer, remote)
- ✅ Service coverage areas with radius

**User Guidance:**
- Blue info banner explains that Quick Edit is needed to modify schedules
- Read-only display keeps interface simple
- All rich data structures properly rendered

#### Visual Design
- **Schedule Type:** Displayed as capitalized text
- **Available Days:** Green badges for active days
- **Time Ranges:** Gray background boxes with day labels
- **Delivery Modes:** Purple badges with descriptive text
- **Coverage Areas:** Card layout with city, country, and radius

## Technical Details

### Button Text Logic
```typescript
{activeStep === steps.length - 1 
  ? (isEditMode ? 'Save Changes' : 'Submit Listing') 
  : 'Next'}
```

### Page Title Logic
```typescript
{isEditMode ? 'Edit Service Listing' : 'Create Service Listing'}
```

### Success Dialog Logic
```typescript
// Title
{isEditMode ? 'Listing Updated Successfully' : 'Listing Created Successfully'}

// Message
{isEditMode 
  ? 'Your changes have been saved!' 
  : 'Your service listing has been submitted!'}

// Description
{isEditMode 
  ? 'Your listing has been updated and the changes are now live.'
  : 'Your listing is now pending approval...'}
```

### Availability Display Logic
```typescript
{typeof listing.availability === 'object' ? (
  // Rich object display with schedules
) : (
  // Simple string display
)}
```
