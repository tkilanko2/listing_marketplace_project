# Removed Redundant "Completed Bookings" Card

## Change
Removed the purple "Completed Bookings" card from the Finance 2 (Alt) page sidebar.

## Reason
The card was showing duplicate information:
- **Card showed**: "9 Total completed service bookings"
- **Already shown in top stats**: "Transactions: 50" and "9 bookings"

## What Was Removed
```typescript
{/* Total Payout History */}
{allFinancialTransactions.filter(t => t.status === 'completed').length > 0 && (
  <div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-[#3D1560] to-[#6D26AB] rounded-xl p-6 text-white shadow-lg">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-3">
      <h3 className="font-bold">Completed Bookings</h3>
      <CheckCircle2 className="w-5 h-5 opacity-80" />
    </div>
    <p className="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">{allFinancialTransactions.filter(t => t.status === 'completed').length}</p>
    <p className="text-sm opacity-90">
      Total completed service bookings
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

## Where Info Still Appears
1. **Top Stats Row** - "Transactions" card shows count
2. **Top Stats Row** - "Total Earnings" card shows "X bookings"
3. **Recent Transactions** section shows the actual list

## Result
- Cleaner, less cluttered sidebar
- No loss of information
- Better use of space for other important actions

âœ… **Improvement made**
