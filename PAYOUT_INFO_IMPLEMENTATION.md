# Payout Information Implementation - Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Added Payout Availability Logic** ✅
Created helper functions in `src/mockData.ts`:
- `isAvailableForWithdrawal(transaction)` - Checks if hold period passed
- `getAvailableBalance(transactions)` - Calculates funds ready for payout
- `getPendingBalance(transactions)` - Calculates funds still in hold

### 2. **Updated Finance 2 Page Display** ✅
- **Available Balance Card**: Shows real calculated available balance
- **Pending Balance Card**: Shows funds still in 3-day hold period
- **Transaction Badges**: 
  - ✅ "Available Now" (green) for past hold period
  - ⏳ "Available [date]" (pink) for still in hold
- Shows count of completed bookings ready for payout

### 3. **Business Logic** ✅
From completed bookings:
- Completion date = appointment date
- Hold period = 3 days after completion
- Available date = completion date + 3 days
- Only completed && paid transactions show up
- Transaction data includes all settlement timeline dates

## 📊 How It Works

### Settlement Timeline:
```
1. Service completed → appointment date
2. Hold starts → completion date + 0 days
3. Hold ends → completion date + 3 days
4. Funds available → available date
5. Payout sent → 15th or 30th of month
6. Processing → 3-7 working days
7. Money received → processed date
```

### Balance Cards:
- **Available**: funds past hold period, ready to withdraw
- **Pending**: funds still in hold period, not yet available
- Shows count of bookings in each category

### Transaction Display:
- Each transaction shows availability status
- Green badge: "Available Now"
- Pink badge: "Available [date]"
- Shows when hold period ends

## 🎯 Result

Seller can now see:
- ✅ Which completed bookings are available for payout
- ✅ Which bookings are still in hold period  
- ✅ Exact dates when funds become available
- ✅ Total amounts ready vs pending
- ✅ Count of bookings in each status

All based on actual completed bookings data! 🚀
