## üí° My Recommendations (Default Implementation)

### If you want me to proceed without further input, I'll implement:

**Export Scope:**
- Modal asking seller to choose:
  - All transactions
  - Current filtered view (last 30 days by default)
  - Custom date range

**Columns Included:**
- Transaction ID, Date, Service Name
- Customer Name, Gross Amount, Net Amount
- Platform Fee, Processing Fee, Transaction Fee
- Status, Payment Method, Available Date

**File Name:**
```
transactions_YYYY-MM-DD.csv
```

**Export Types:**
- Start with Transaction Export only
- Can add others later

**User Experience:**
1. Click "Export Reports"
2. Modal opens with date range options
3. Click "Download"
4. CSV downloads
5. Toast: "‚úÖ Report exported successfully!"

**Location:**
- Quick Actions sidebar (current button)
