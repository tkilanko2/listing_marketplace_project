# Fixing Zero Balance Issue

## Problem
Finance page showing $0.00 because no completed bookings exist in `currentSellerMockOrders`

## Solution
Updated two bookings to be completed with appointments 5 days ago (past hold period):
- BKG-CS-004: Changed status from 'confirmed' to 'completed'
- BKG-CS-006: Appointment date moved back to 5 days ago (already completed)

## Business Logic
- Hold period: 3 days after completion
- If completed 5 days ago → available for 2 days now
- Finance page shows these as "Available Now"

## Result
✅ Finance page now shows:
- Available Balance > $0
- Pending Balance > $0  
- Transaction history with real data
- Settlement timeline information
