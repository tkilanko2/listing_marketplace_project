# Finance Page (Alt) - All Fixes Complete ✅

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Payout Showing Wrong Data - **FIXED**

**Before:**
- Hard-coded date: "Apr 15, 2024"
- Static text: "Apr 18-22 (3-7 processing days)"

**After:**
- Dynamic calculation: `getNextPayoutDates()` returns 15th or 30th of current/next month
- Real dates: Calculated based on current date
- Arrival window: `formatDate(earliestDate) - formatDate(latestDate)`

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// src/mockData.ts
export function getNextPayoutDates() {
  const now = new Date();
  const currentDay = now.getDate();
  let payoutDate: Date;
  
  if (currentDay < 15) {
    payoutDate = new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 15);
  } else if (currentDay < 30) {
    payoutDate = new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 30);
  } else {
    payoutDate = new Date(currentYear, currentMonth + 1, 15);
  }
  
  return {
    payoutDate,
    earliestDate: new Date(payoutDate + 3 days),
    latestDate: new Date(payoutDate + 7 days),
    windowLabel: formatted date string
  };
}
```

### 2. ✅ View Booking CTA Not Opening - **FIXED**

**Before:**
- CTA existed but navigation wasn't working

**After:**
- Handler verified in `App.tsx`: `handleViewSellerBookingDetails` ✓
- Props passed to Finance 2: `onViewBookingDetails` ✓
- Modal button wired: Calls handler with `bookingId` ✓
- Navigation works: Opens `SellerBookingDetailsPage` ✓

**Flow:**
```
User clicks "View Booking" 
→ calls onViewBookingDetails(bookingId)
→ handleViewSellerBookingDetails in App.tsx
→ finds booking in getAllOrdersWithBookings()
→ sets selectedSellerBooking
→ navigates to 'sellerBookingDetails' page
```

### 3. ✅ Dummy Data Instead of Real Mock Data - **FIXED**

**Root Cause:**
- `CURRENT_SELLER_ID = providers[0].id` (random on each load)
- Bookings referenced `mockServices` with different provider IDs
- Filter `order.service?.provider?.id === sellerId` found NO matches
- Result: $0.00 for all balances

**Solution:**
Updated 3 key bookings to explicitly use `providers[0]`:
```typescript
// BKG-CS-001, BKG-CS-004, BKG-CS-007
service: {
  ...(mockServices.find(...)),
  provider: providers[0] // ← CRITICAL FIX
}
```

**Completed Bookings for Finance:**
1. **BKG-CS-004**: Executive Consultation - $350 (5 days ago) → **Available**
2. **BKG-CS-007**: Photography - $400 (7 days ago) → **Available**

**Expected Result:**
- Available Balance: ~$683 (2 bookings past 3-day hold)
- Pending Balance: $0 (no recent completed bookings)
- 2 transactions showing
- Real settlement dates
- Proper fee breakdown
